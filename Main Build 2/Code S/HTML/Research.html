        <p class="RS_content">Samaya drew inspiration from the sleek designs and well-organized layouts of Chrono24 and other similar houses. I admired the comprehensive and carefully organized menu problem and its simplistic use of dropdowns and options. So, I incorporated this approach into Samaya, but embellished it with something that showed elegance and exclusivity, that is along the lines of minimal text and simplicity. <br><br>
            The body was inspired by the key visual tagline and luxurious watch imagery, but relegated to something more elegant and upscale with the use of a high-contrast black background. The tagline I chose-"Excellence Beyond Expectation"-mirrors their aspirational tone yet emphasizes craftsmanship and precision, making the design uniquely aligned with my brand identity.

        <h1 class="RS_head1">Product Page</h1>
        <p class="RS_content1">My reference point for the website, Samaya, was the product page of Saint Laurent. Their employment of grunge, large images of extremely high quality was notable, and thus I used a relatively similar grid format to showcase the elegance and craftsmanship of watches. A light, clean background of Saint Laurent speaks a modern vibe, whereas I put forth a bold, dark message reflecting an attitude of exclusivity. <br><br>
            Both concepts tell a story through visuals, ensuring each product is striking enough to draw the eyes yet balanced and structured. The experience thus rendered is ornate yet immersive and even bespoke to my identity as a brand whilst channeling a sublime and lavish simplicity referenced.

        <h1 class="RS_head2">Team Page</h1>
        <p class="RS_content2">I drew inspiration for Samaya’s team page from Hodinkee’s contributor section. Hodinkee’s layout, which features contributors’ names, images, and short descriptions, influenced the clean, structured design of my team page. I adapted this idea by incorporating larger, more personalized team member profiles with high-quality images and detailed descriptions, emphasizing individuality. While Hodinkee uses a light, minimalist aesthetic, I opted for a bold, dark theme to align with Samaya’s luxurious branding. Both designs effectively highlight the individuals behind the brand, creating an approachable and professional tone while maintaining a cohesive, brand-centric look. </p>

        <h1 class="RS_head3">Footer</h1>
        <p class="RS_content3">For Samaya's footer, I drew inspiration from the clean and orderly design of Louis Vuitton. Louis Vuitton's footer is extremely well-put-together and has navigation possibilities, links to assistance for customers, and brand information in a neat, minimalist design. Similarly, I incorporated a structured approach for the Samaya footer, enabling easy access to important links covering policies, accessibility, and social media. However, I have now used a strong dark aesthetic to maintain Samaya's brand image. I have also inserted a contact form right in the bottom and encouraged user actions. Both designs aim for clarity and usability so that visitors may locate the information they are after with minimal effort while projecting that lofty, exclusive feel. </p>

        <h1 class="RS_head4">Blog Page</h1>
        <p class="RS_content4">I designed the blog page of Samaya as a minimalistic version of the structured Gucci history page. In its lay-out, Gucci is neat and structured, employing headings that allow reading without distraction. I, therefore, did same for Samaya; an impressive and structured display with a dash of boldness, while remaining in global charts and bringing or improving upon contrast, about text and black is added. Due to the hierarchy that makes things easy to read, I used the same hierarchy for Jamaya, with an intention to - while still maintaining branding-and clarity, highlights of the main points pertaining to useful technology and innovations for watches. The brand coherence comes from type and style yet responds with clarity and beauty and information on the blog page. </p>
